But, this feeling can be short-lived or may even remain unexperienced if the deployment strategy employed isn't the most suitable one for the project in question or a given scenario.\nAccording to OpenShift:\n\nA deployment strategy is a way to change or upgrade an application with the aim of no perceptible downtime.\n\nThere are numerous deployment strategies employed in Software Development and DevOps but two of them very important and widely used are;\n\nRolling Deployment\nCanary Deployment\n\nRolling Deployment#\n\nIn rolling deployment, the upgraded version of system or app is brought online in incremental changes.\nDifferent parts of the system are introduced to the production environment over time. It is a staged rollout approach where different components of the system are upgraded one at a time during each iteration of the deployment.\nLet's Imagine#\n\nWe have 3 servers running our system or application currently deployed with version v1.0.\nIn a rolling deployment, we might take down the first server, load it with the upgraded version v2.0 of the application, and bring it back online.\nWhen we have made sure that everything works fine and as expected, we move on to deploy our latest version on the next server in our server line up; we take down the legacy server, load it up with latest upgrade and pull it back online. This process is repeated until every server is operating on the latest upgrade.\nIn this way, the latest application is gradually deployed to the production environment.\nThe following illustration shows rollout phases that take place in this rolling deployment example.\n\nAdvantages#\n\nRolling deployment has some key benefits, such as:\nDowntime Prevention#\n\nThis strategy prevents downtime because even if one server is taken down in order for an upgrade, other servers are still operational and receive traffic accordingly. The load balancer of the app can be configured to distribute the traffic efficiently among the servers online. In this way, the users don't experience any service unavailability and upgrade process goes by smoothly.\nEarly Mitigation#\n\nDuring rolling deployment, if our upgraded system shows any undefined behaviour or if any issues are spotted, they can be mitigated early on. Since the rate of upgrade propagation is slow, the deployment can be put a halt to or hotfixes can be issued to remedy the discrepancies on the go.\nThe gist is that we are only exposing a small part of our system to the new version at any given time.\nDisadvantages#\n\nEverything comes at a cost and Rolling Deployment is no different;\nSlow Deployment#\n\nOne major pain point of this strategy is that application upgrade happens at a very slow rate. This can be an issue in case if currently deployed version is facing downtime or contains any bugs.\nProblem Propagation#\n\nIf some problems slip through the initial checks and remain un-addressed, those can make it through the whole system bringing the entire application down or at the risk of failure.\nNo Targeted Rollouts Support#\n\nRolling deployment doesn't support targeted rollouts because the user base is not controlled whether to be redirected to the newer version or current one. The load balancer randomly selects a server based on the current server load, following a random allocation method.\nRolling deployment strategy balances the deployment impact of upgraded versions to production environment and mitigates the risk of potential downtime during an upgrade. So it is a common choice in Software Devlopment and DevOps to choose this strategy for app deployment.\nCanary Deployment#\n\nIn Canary Deployment, a subset of already running servers are deployed with the newer version of the system and a smaller set of users are systematically redirected to these servers. This set of servers is called a Canary.\nThis strategy is actually a derivative of an age-old practice by coal miners. They used to take Canary birds into coal mines in order to find out if the toxic gases within the mine are reaching dangerous levels. In case they did, the bird would get distressed and signal the miners to evacuate.\nThe Strategy#\n\nDuring canary deployment, the small set of servers are chosen based on some predefined criteria.\nThe canaries can be selected based on geographical location, device type or just a specific group of users. It really depends on the need of hour, but once chosen, the canaries are used to monitor the performance of the new version under real-world conditions but on a much smaller and safer scale.\nIf the system performs well and as expected, then staged rollout of the newer version is performed to the remaining servers, gradually upgrading the whole system. But if there occur any problems, the deployment can be halted, thereby, affecting a much smaller userbase. The problems can be fixed later right inside the canary, then tested out and deployed again.\nlet's solidify our understanding through a practical use case scenario.\nLet's Imagine... Again#\n\nWe have 6 severs running version v1.0.of our system and we want to use Canary Deployment to upgrade our system. In this case, we need to define a criteria to select the canary servers. Let's say we opt to use 33% of our servers to run the newer version. To do so, we take down 2 of 6 servers, transform them into a separate cluster, and load them up with the version v2.0 of our app and redeploy them to the production line up.\nNow we have 2 separate deployments of the same system. We can direct a certain amount of traffic, ideally 33% in this case, and monitor the performance of the version v2.0.\nThe figure below, emulates the actual implementation of this scenario.\n\nAdvantages#\n\nCanary deployment comes with its own perks, for example;\nResilience#\n\nEven if something goes wrong, we already have 67% of our servers operating on the stable version of our app so we can redirect the impacted users there. A slightly large load will develop on the existing server, but user frustration can be evaded in this way. Which means that our deployment strategy is resilient in case of any faults.\nTargeted Rollouts!#\n\nPerhaps the most important part of Canary deployment is that it enables us to perform targeted rollouts. We can customize our user selection criteria to our liking such as testing our system's performance on specific device type or user's geographical location.\nDisadvantages#\n\nThis strategy also comes with some challenges, such as:\nCareful Monitoring &amp; Testing#\n\nCanary deployment requires careful monitoring in order to observe the system's performance. Automated testing is required to perform system's performance evaluation\nScaled Automation#\n\nIf the system deployed to Canary works fine, its redeployment to the rest of servers requires extensive automation so that newer version can be rolled out as soon as possible.\nTo control the deployment, extra infrastructure tooling is required in order to configure the allocation or deallocation of resources in case if scaling up or halting the deployments is required, respectively.\nCanary deployment is often employed alongside the Rolling deployment strategy in order to bring best of the both worlds together.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/canary-vs-rolling-deployments/","title":"Canary and Rolling Deployment Strategies Explained"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/category-theory-rant/":{"body":"In Category Theory, the following relation is isomorphic and not identical:\nh .

Interfaces are abstract which means that we are not allowed to instantiate them. For some type to be compatible with an interface, it has to implement the methods specified in the interface. This process is referred to as satisfying of the interface.\nIn short, the primary purpose of their existence is a behavioral one; they enable us to treat different types as the same as long as these types share some common behavior.\nIn Go, an interface can be declared as follows:\n\nThe name can be anything apart from Duck but there's a reason I chose that name, let's dig deeper.\nThe Duck Typing Test#\n\nGo is a strongly typed language. This means we cannot have a type opt in to hold different type of data once it has been declared. That gives huge benefits in terms of code predictability, static analysis and, just-in-time debugging, but it comes with a cost - we no longer have type flexibility.\nStrong nature of a language prevents the programmer from inventing unanticipated types. There's a set of types built into the language that are to be utilized and hence, there's no middle ground between types. It is either one way or the another.\nEither you got a string or you have an int; nothing in between... or is it?\nIntroducing Duck Typing... test, it goes like this:\n\nIf it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck - Wikipedia\n\nThe crux of Duck Typing principle is the idea that code does not care whether an object is a duck but rather it concerns with the fact that it quacks or not.\nLet's make sense out of it with some code. We define the glorious Duck interface as before:\n\nWe declare a type interface named Duck. The Duck interface characterizes a contract for any subsequent types that satisfy it. But as of now, it is quite vague since there are no rules defined here. This is where methods come in handy. Methods describe the kind of behavior a type would need to exhibit in order to satisfy the interface.\nWe know that a duck should be able to walk and quack. Let's add these two methods to our interface;\n\nWe have added the required rules of the contract. It is now job of the type in question to implement these methods to be given the perk of being categorised as a duck.\nAn important distinction to note here is that this mechanism in Go is called Structural Typing as it has a static type system.\nDuck Typing is more suited for languages which are dynamic in nature such as Python and/or Elixir, etc. But nonetheless, goal of both design patterns is the same.\nImplementing the Interface#\n\nThere are countless types of ducks out there with varied attributes, such as color, size or flying capabilities. Let's take for example, the Mandarin and Grebes.\nGrebes are primarily found in lakes. They are known for their diving abilities. Mandarin ducks prefer wooded areas near ponds. They often like to remain static. That's quite an array of differences, right?\nlet's create the structs named after these types of ducks;\nFor Grebe:\n\nsimilarly, for Mandarin:\n\nThese are different types by definition, we cannot assign their instances to one another.\nWhat if we have a function that expects just any type of duck regardless of their differences? Mandarin and Grebe are both reasonable candidates. After all, they are ducks. They can walk and quack.\nEssentially what we need here is some sort of polymorphic behavior.\nInterfaces for Polymorphism#\n\nThe ability of an object to behave in multiple ways is called Polymorphism. It is evident from our discussion that we need both duck types to exhibit the behavior of a general duck. Let us suppose there is a function that expects an object which satisfies the Duck interface:\n\nAs of now, we cannot pass in the instances of Grebe or MandarinDuck. This can only be achieved once we implement the Duck interface on both duck types.\nThe basic syntax to implement the methods of an interface in Go is pretty similar to defining normal functions. We just provide an object of the type which we intend to implement the interface on.\nFor MandarinDuck:\n\nsimilarly, for Grebe type:\n\nNow, we can pass an object of any of these types to our DuckAcceptor(d Duck) function. d is now a generic duck type. The is the power polymorhism. A single type automatically binding to an appropriate sub type without programmer's intervention. And we achieved this through interfaces.\nlet's see how this affects our program. We instantiate both structs,\n\nNow if we call our DuckAcceptor(d Duck) function twice passing an object of each type respectively, we see that the Walk() and Quack() functions respond to the internal type change.\n\nWe can already envision the output, that is:\n\nObvious... right?\nSummarizing it, interfaces are a powerful tool that enable us to achieve polymorphism in our code. They help us group related functionality together and make our code reusable.\nThe Empty Interface#\n\nThere's only piece to the puzzle that remains to be solved and that is the Empty Interface.\nGo is primarily a statically typed language which means that every type needs to be known at compile time before the code is executed. This prevents type flexibility. Luckily, Go allows the programmer to make assumptions about types and this can be achieved through the empty interface, so what's an empty interface?\nAn interface which has zero contract protocols(methods) is called empty interface\nlet's quickly define one:\n\nWhat good does it do? glad you asked! every type in go automatically implements the empty interface because it does not put any rules(methods) in place to be satisfied with. So we can basically start to qualify even our simple data types such as, int or string as interface{}. let's see an example from the official docs:\n\nThe output is:\n\nAs we can see, any variable can take on any(no pun intended) type of data. The describe() is a custom function that describes type of information of the passed in arguments.\nEmpty interfaces are of great use when creating Go packages and libraries. There are some pitfalls or caveats to this approach such as the need of constant Type Assertions but that's a story for some another time.\nI hope you had a very good time here and picked up a thing or two. Happy Go-ing!!!\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/go-interfaces-guide/","title":"Go Interfaces: A Beginner's Guide"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/intro-to-concurrency-in-golang/":{"body":"Introduction#\n\nRob Pike, one of the creators of the Go programming language, is often attributed with the following quote:\n\nConcurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.\n\nSimplest real life example to this could arguably be multi-tasking. When we multi-task, we are basically switching from one task to another in, hopefully, an efficient manner. That's how we get multiple tasks done in lesser time. That's concurrency for you!\nNow imagine you have got a few friends to help you through those tasks. Each of you assign yourself to a specific task and then begin the grind. Some time later, every friend including you finishes their respective task. This is an example of parallelism.\nThere exist programming analogues of the few terms that I have emphasized above, these are:\nTask: Any job that is supposed to be performed by a computer program.\nYou : Signifies the main thread of the program which is performing the said task.\nFriend : This is the helper thread that helps the main thread in getting the task done quickly.\nWith that out of the way, we can now talk about how Go deals with concurrency.\nGo Concurrency Model#\n\nGo introduced a few constructs to make it easy for the developers to create concurrently executable programs, namely:\n\nGoroutines (co-routines in other languages)\nChannels\n\nGoroutines#\n\nGo uses functions to facilitate the use of goroutines.\n\nA goroutine is a function that runs concurrently to other functions.\n\nIt is functionally synonymous to an operating system thread because it is an independent unit of execution but there exist several differences, which make goroutines a better choice in terms of concurrency.\nFor instance, goroutines:\n\nare lightweight\nhave minimal memory-footprint.\nare easy to create and manage (via channels).\nare scheduled in user-space by the Go scheduler instead of kernel-space by OS kernel.\nhave low context-switching cost.\n\nIn Go, if function call is preceded by the keyword go, it becomes a goroutine. In code, it looks like this:\n\nIn Go, every function qualifies to be a goroutine, which implies that a program's main function can also be a goroutine.\nIn above code snippet, there are two goroutines; main and the greetGuest, former is made into a goroutine by Go runtime whereas greetGuest becomes a goroutine as its invocation follows the go keyword.\nIn this way, the greetGuest function runs concurrently with the main function, and executes its instructions independently.\nThe main function after creating the goroutine, immediately ends because there are no more instructions to run. It does not wait for the greetGuest goroutine to finish its job. We can change this behaviour, and make it wait but we will look into this later in the article.\nAs you might have noticed, we didn't store the squared value returned by the square goroutine. This is because we cannot!  Goroutines are not ordinary functions; they are mini-programs that perform specialized tasks which they are created for.\nBut - what if we absolutely need a goroutine to return a value before terminating? For example, let's say we want to compute the arithmetic sum of an array by decomposing it into subarrays and then process each one using a goroutine? Logically, those goroutines would've to send the computed values back to the main goroutine; this is where channels come into play. Channels are the construct introduced by Go to manage and synchronize goroutines effectively.\nChannels#\n\n\nChannels provide a medium for goroutines to communicate with each other.\n\nThey can be used to synchronize the execution and state across goroutines. A channel can be created with its name followed by the keyword chan  where type is any built-in data-type.\nChannels are shared-memory blocks under the hood. When a channel is created, it is basically a pointer to that memory block which we can share around with goroutines for mutual access.\n\nHere, ch is a nil channel of type int which can neither store nor transmit any value because it is not initialized. We can pass it to the built-in make function, which allocates and initializes an object of various types including channel.\n\nThis is now a proper channel which can help share data among goroutines.\nCommunication Types#\n\nChannels facilitate communication between goroutines but communication has several types, such as:\n\nSimplex communication is a unidirectional or a one-way communication scheme where only one side can send data. The receiving side cannot send any information back to the transmitting side. Publisher-Subscriber design pattern is based on simplex communication because data flows only from publisher to the subscriber and not the other way around.\nHalf-duplex communication occurs when both parties are capable of receiving and transmitting data but only one side can send data at a time. It is sort of a synchronous form of communication in the sense that it requires co-ordination from both sides because the data must be consumed by a side before the channel is ready to receive further data.\nFull-duplex is a synchronous, two-way communication system where both sides can send and receive data simultaneously. Examples include chat messaging systems, and real-time video-conferencing.\nGo enables these communication mechanisms through Buffered and Unbuffered channels in addition to multi-channel communication.\nBuffered vs. Unbuffered Channels#\n\nAn unbuffered channel can be created using the make function without specifying a buffer size. The\nmake function, by default, creates a channel of unit capacity, which means that it can hold only one value at a time. Both sides can send and receive data from such a channel but only when the channel is empty. If it's not then the value must first be consumed by either the sender or receiver goroutine. Unbuffered channels help us establish partially synchronous communication system between goroutines.\nTo create a buffered channel to establish asynchronous communication between goroutines, a buffer size can be passed to the make function along with the channel type. For example:\n\nThis creates a buffered channel with capacity of holding 2 integer values simulataneously, so the sender, after sending a value to the channel, doesn't have to wait for the receiver to read it, before sending another one.\nThis communication mode is asynchronous, however, it's not a Full-duplex communication system. That could only be achieved if we opened two separate channels instead of increasing the channel capacity. Full-duplex communication requires both parties to be able to send and receive messages at the same time, which a single channel cannot allow because concurrent access without blocking can introduce data races.\nLet's work through an example to understand the usage and power of Channels\nA Nice Concurrency Problem#\n\n\nCalculate the sum of subarrays concurrently!\n\nFirst, create a function that receives a channel and an array to sum.\nWe initalize the sum variable, then use a for loop to compute the sum of array. Lastly, the computed value is written into the channel with special syntax that is &lt;- (an arrow) after the channel name.\n\nNext, we initialize a channel and a supposedly large integer array, inside the main function. We also calculate the mid-point of array to split it in two equal parts in order to distribute it between a couple of goroutines.\n\nNow, a totalSum variable is initialized to 0 to hold the combined sum from different goroutines. Then, a couple of goroutines are created to sum the array segments. We pass the channel ch created above, and the intended segments to each goroutine.\nWhen the first goroutine is created, the main function doesn't wait for the result and continues its execution. It then creates another goroutine to calculate the sum of 2nd half. Array splitting is done through slicing which follows the syntax: arr[start:end], where the starting index is inclusive while the ending index is exclusive. When the 'end' is omitted, it means to slice through till the end of array.\n\nFinally, we are ready to receive the partial sums from those goroutines.\n\nTo receive from a channel, an arrow before its name is placed. We receive a value from the channel, and add it to the totalSum variable. This is a blocking operation because we are reading from an empty channel. Execution of the main function would be blocked until one of the goroutines produces a result and sends it to the channel. When it happens, the main function immediately reads it, and adds it to the variable, making the channel empty again. The next instruction would also be a blocking one. We wait until the final goroutine returns a value into the channel which gets added to the total sum.\nFinally, the totalSum is printed to the console.\nHere's all the code for reference:\n\nTakeaways#\n\nConcurrency in Go makes handling multiple tasks simple, with goroutines and channels. Goroutines let you run functions concurrently in a memory-efficient way, while channels help with friction-less, controlled communication between these goroutines.\nMoreover, slicing and channel synchronization, solves problems involving multiple tasks—like splitting and summing arrays. The Go runtime manages much of this behind the scenes.\n\nI hope you picked up a thing or two from this one, happy learning!!\n\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/intro-to-concurrency-in-golang/","title":"Introduction to concurrency in Golang"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/linked-list-in-golang/":{"body":"Table of Contents#\n\n\nIntroduction\nSo, Why Linked Lists?\nImplementation in Go\n\nDefining Node*\nDefining Linked List\nInsert A Node at Given Index\nTraversing the Linked List\nDeleting a Node at Given Index\n\nGarbage Collection in Go\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction#\n\nA Linked List is a linear data structure in Computer Science that stores data in a non-contiguous fashion in computer memory. It comprises nodes or elements that are interconnected through logical links. These links are established from one node to another using memory addresses.\nLogical Representation#\n\n\nEach node consists of, at least, two basic parts. One is called the data or payload part and the other is the link or pointer part. The former stores the data intended for the current node while the pointer part links the current node to the next one in the list or it points to the end of the list.\nLinked Lists are extensively employed in real-world software development. They are truly fundamental to the implementation of other data structures such as Trees, Stacks, Queues, and Adjacency Matrix. Linked Lists are also the basis to Dynamic Memory Management (DMM).\nWhy?#\n\nComputer memory is fundamentally laid out in sequential manner. When our program tries to store some data onto the RAM, it contacts the memory allocator of our system and requests for the required amount of bytes. The memory allocator then allocates, if available, the required amount from our RAM, and returns its address back to our program.\nSequential layout is an inherent property of the memory management mechanism, and comes with its own benefits and drawbacks.\nFor example,#\n\nIf our program asks for allocation of an array, the memory allocator simply allocates a sequence of bytes sufficient enough and returns back the address to the start of the array. The array is then easy to work with, manipulate and/or traverse. We just need the base address to point to the start of the array and use offset bytes of comprising data type in order to address our array. While this sounds pretty nifty, these comforts bite back when we need to either scale up or scale down our memory requirements.\nAn Array of Capacity, 7.#\n\n\nStatic data structures like arrays allocate memory at the compile time, often leading to inefficiencies. Unused memory can go to waste, while in high-demand situations it might be easily depleted, causing memory shortages. The scaling challenge of both excess and shortage illustrate the limitations of static memory allocation.\nIntroducing Linked Lists ...#\n\nLinked lists offer a dynamic solution to memory management. Unlike static data structures such as arrays, linked list allocates memory as needed over time. This dynamic allocation results in efficient resource utilization and avoids memory waste.\nMemory Layout of a Linked List#\n\n\nA linked list consists of nodes, logically connected to each other via memory addresses. The logical neighboring node may not be a physical neighbor of the previous or next node in the memory. This dynamic nature eliminates the scaling issues found in sequential data structures.\nImplementation#\n\nLet's implement a linked list in Go language. Go is a statically typed, compiled, high-level and an expressive programming language which is syntactically very similar to C class of programming languages. We are going to implement the essential functionality of a linked list in order to demonstrate how a linked list is created, used, and manipulated. Our goal is to write an API that is capable of the following;\n\nInsertion of a node at any valid index given.\nTraversal of the linked list\nDeletion of a node at the index provided.\n\nWe will try to take care of edge cases and follow best practices. Let's begin;\nNode#\n\nThe Node represents the fundamental unit of linked list data structure, encapsulating both the payload as well as the reference to the next node in the sequence.\nWe can use the struct type in Go to define a node.\n\nOur Node has data field of type empty interface meaning that it can store data of any data type. The other field is named next which is of type *Node, translating to the fact that it can contain reference to the next node in the list.\nLinkedList#\n\nOur next step is to define a struct named LinkedList, which consists of two fields, namely head and len;\n\nhead is a pointer of type *Node because it would hold the address of the first node in the list. Meanwhile, len keeps the count of nodes present in the list. The default values of head and len are nil and 0, respectively. These are automatically assigned by the Go runtime\nWe are now ready to implement the routines for carrying out the functional operations on our LinkedList struct.\nFirstly, we tackle the insertion operation.\nInsert#\n\nThe prototype of our insert method is as follows;\n\nIt takes two parameters;\n\nThe value to be stored in the node\nindex at which the value is to be inserted.\n\ninsert returns an error in case of unsuccessful insert operation.\nFollowing the best practices, we will make sure that the edge cases are covered and appropriate error message is returned in case of errors. The list should be 0 indexed to imitate the behavior that of arrays or slices.\nLet's work our way through it. First of all, we make sure that the the index given is neither less than 0 nor greater than size of the list.\n\nIf the conditions are not met, we construct a new index out of bounds error using errors package and return it to caller function, effectively halting the insertion operation.\nIn case of index within bounds, we move to the next step, that is, the creation of a new node.\n\nWe create a node on the heap memory using Go's new allocation primitive, which returns the memory address of the newly created node. Which is stored in the newNode pointer. We assign the given value to the data fields and set the next field to nil because this node isn't yet a part of the list.\nAfter the successful creation of newNode, it is time to insert into the list. We have to take the index into account, if its value is 0 then newNode is supposed to be the first node in the list and head pointer of the list is going to point towards it.\n\nnewNode's next field is assigned the value of current head. If the list is empty, it would benil, otherwise, it would point to the first node in the list. The length of list is incremented by 1 and nil is returned. This marks a successful insertion at the start of the list.\nNow, we need to tackle the general case, that is, insertion at any valid index. This involves a better planning strategy because we need to take care of the previous node in the list as well.\nThe algorithm to insert node at an arbitrary index, say n, is as follows:\n\nCreate a tempHead pointer that serves as an alias for list's head pointer..\nScan the list by utilizing the tempHead and get to the n-1th node.\nAssign newNode's next field to the n-1th node's next field.\nNow point the n-1th node's next to the newly created node.\n\nThe Go code to achieve this looks like this;\n\nBelow is a visual illustration of this procedure.\n\nThe newNode ends up at the provided index. This concludes the implementation of insert operation. The final results looks like this:\n\nNow let's implement traverse method.\nTraverse#\n\n\nScanning through the list from start to finish and printing each node's value is referred to as traversal.\n\nThe method's prototype is as follows:\n\nTraversal is straightforward to implement. We create a temporary pointer initialized with list.head. We then run a loop till the end of the list. We might either utilize the list's length to determine its end or use the fact that the list ends with the last node's next field pointing towards nil.\nThe latter is a more concise option. We check the current node's next field, and stop the loop if points to nil.\n\n\\t used in fmt.Printf() prints a tab after each value. The value stored in current node's data is printed in each iteration and then tempHead is assigned the next node's address in the list, thereby moving forward in the list.\nNow that we are done with implementing insert and traverse operations, we move towards last important method which is delete operation.\nDelete#\n\ndelete is logically very similar to insert and involves almost the same steps, but instead of inserting the node, we remove a node from the list at the given index.\n\nOur first step is to ensure index range safety. This is different than that of insert. The index specified should be in range of 0 to (n-1) instead of being in range 1 to n. This is because a node can be inserted at the nth index but removal requires a node to be already present at the given index.\n\nIf index is in range, we handle the special case of deletion which pertains to removal of a node from the beginning of the list.\nWe simply make the head pointer point to the next pointer of the node at index 0, essentially deleting the first node.\n\nGarbageCollection#\n\nThis is the most important part to understand. You might have noticed that we didn't have to deallocate the node ourselves like we do in C class of languages, and this is because of GO's Garbage Collection.\n\nGo is a garbage collected language. The application binary generated by its compiler actually comes with a managed runtime. When the binary is executed, the garbage collector runs in the background tracking the program's resources.\n\nWhen a resource, such as, this deleted node is found to be lurking around in the memory without any live reference , the node's resources are automatically released and it is removed from the memory by the GC. This way, the programmer doesn't have to do the memory management manually, thus increasing productivity and development speed.\nNow, onto the general case of deletion at an arbitrary index.\nThe steps are pretty similar to that of insertion operation.\n\nCreate tempHead pointing towards list.head.\nScan the list by utilizing the tempHead and get to the index-1th node.\nAssign this node's next the next node's next, thereby skipping the node present at index position.\n\nin delete method, we add the following:\n\nThe following visual illustration helps understand this better,\n\nFollowing is the final form of delete method.\n\nThis concludes the implementation of a working linked list in GO programming language. A lot of details, optimizations and functionalities have been skipped over in favor of brevity, and conciseness of this write up.\nI hope that you picked up on a thing or two, peace!\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/linked-list-in-golang/","title":"Linked List in Golang"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/markdown/":{"body":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Zola\ncontent files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS\nin a Zola theme.\nHeadings#\n\nThe following HTML &lt;h1&gt;—&lt;h6&gt; elements represent six levels of section\nheadings. &lt;h1&gt; is the highest section level while &lt;h6&gt; is the lowest.\nH1#\n\nH2#\n\nH3#\n\nH4#\n\nH5#\n\nH6#\n\nParagraph#\n\nXerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.

I had just realized that the variable us is actually not in the argument list.\nIf we take look at the above snippet, the us variable is being passed separately to the function before the function name, and this is what refers to as Receiver Parameter Idiom in Go, where the idiom bit signifies a common or established pattern.\n\nIn Go, a receiver parameter is a special parameter in a method declaration that allows a type to define methods that can be called on its instances.\n\nThis pattern is primarily used to tie functions to a specific type, which in this case happens to be UserStore. It is less strict imitation of an Object Oriented Programming approach called Encapsulation, which means ensuring the privacy of the content of an object.\nSince Go does not qualify as purely Object Oriented language, it doesn't have any explicit constructs for data hiding like private or protected which are present in languages like C++ and Java, for example. So the attempt at encapsulation is not an enforcement but rather a suggestion.\nThe associating of methods to a certain type also introduces modularity because functionality related to certain type is closely coupled to that type only, and the functions defined that type basically act as an extensional interface towards outside world.\nLet's see a short example,\n\nI have defined a Point struct and a couple of methods surrounding its usage. The NewPoint constructs a new Point object and returns it while the Distance method calculates the Euclidian distance between two such points. If we look closely, the later one uses receiver parameter which means we can call this method directly on a Point object or a pointer to its object. Choosing between passing an object by value or by reference to a method depends on whether we want to modify the original object or if the object size is relatively larger, making the copy operation an expensive choice.\nin the main function:\n\nIn the main function, we create two points and then calculate the distance between them.\nThis is is the essence of associating a method with an object, we get to use . (dot) syntax call this function which is a bit more OOPs like. It is also evident that the NewPoint is not inherently connected to the Point because doesn't receive its object unlike Distance. This can be confirmed by the first line of the main function where we create a point without involving the NewPoint method. This isn't to say that we can't do the same for finding the distance without using Distance method rather to convey the fact that the user of this function will immediately recognize the connection between the Point and Distance.\nMoreover, in case if were importing these functions from and outside package or module, the second method would automatically seem to be more closely related to the Point because it already operates on its object.\nThanks for reading!\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/receiver-parameter-idiom-go/","title":"Receiver Parameter Idiom in Golang"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1025/":{"body":25,"description":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/":{"body":0,"description":5,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/canary-vs-rolling-deployments/":{"body":697,"description":0,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/category-theory-rant/":{"body":46,"description":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/go-interfaces-guide/":{"body":594,"description":0,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/intro-to-concurrency-in-golang/":{"body":861,"description":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/linked-list-in-golang/":{"body":1026,"description":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/markdown/":{"body":367,"description":4,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/ownership-enums-pattern-matching/":{"body":147,"description":0,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/receiver-parameter-idiom-go/":{"body":272,"description":0,"title":4}},"length":10},"lang":"English"}
